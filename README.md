FR4 Renovation project 
===

This is our - the new 2019 control group - try to make our 2014 robot, FR4, usable again and suitable for school events / casual playing.
The codebase is based on our new robot base for 2019 which uses the Gradle build system instead of Ant, and is being developed using IntelliJ instead of Eclipse.

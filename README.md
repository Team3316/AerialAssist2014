Robot code template
===

This is DBug's new robot code template, based on the older
one we have from 2015: [RobotBase](https://github.com/frc3316/RobotBase).

This template includes:
 - Basic folder structure for using the Command-based approach
 - A custom logging framework
 - A configuration app, which is separate from the robot code for faster upload

TODO: 
 - [ ] Add path planning & auto utilities
 - [ ] Make SDB better
